## Definition of data drift
The goal is to present a simple and intuitive overview of the definition, types, and case studies of data drift. Introducing related concepts: Out-Of-Distribution (OOD), Long-Tail Distribution, Non-IID, and Few-Shot Learning.

## Model Adaptation
### Before Deployment
Continual Learning (by He, Li), Meta-Learning, Federated Learning
### After Deployment
Parameter-Efficient: Prompt Adapter, LoRA, Prefix tuning
Resource-Efficient: Edge-Cloud Collaboration (by Chen), Test-Time Training, Transfer Learning
Data-Efficient: Data Selection Mechanisms Based on Gradients, Entropy, Data Annotation (Language Models, Pseudo-Label Generation)

## Challenges and Directions
### Framework/Platform Development
### Datasets/Benchmarks
### Integration with Large Models
### Multi-Model Management
### Knowledge Base Construction
